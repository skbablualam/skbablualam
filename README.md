## 🔧 About Me

I'm a System Administrator turned DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation, cloud infrastructure, and improving system reliability through scripting and open-source tools. With hands-on experience in hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud), I specialize in streamlining infrastructure deployments and security patching using tools like **Ansible**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **Bash/Python scripting**.

My goal is to design scalable, secure, and automated solutions to modern IT challenges—and always stay ahead by learning and contributing back to the community.
